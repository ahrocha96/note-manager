#ERRORS/BUGS
#I noticed the Lumen requirement when I was nearly done. 
#I implemented an authentication check, but I can work on adding the 
#Lumen framework in the next day or two.
#
#I will be deploying this to heroku as well, I can send a link when I have
#the dependencies figured out. HTTP 500 error the first few deploys
#
#TODO
#I might include a search function to enhance the retrieval UX for the user.
